			<p>Greetings, internet! This is my third attempt at writing my &ldquo;first&rdquo; blog post, and hopefully it&rsquo;ll stick this time. Life has thrown me some curveballs over the past few years, from graduating college to dealing with a breakup and moving away for a 9-month study program that wasn&rsquo;t quite what I hoped for. Then I landed a job at a major automotive company that paid well, but left me feeling unsatisfied and unchallenged.</p>
<p>Things only got worse when Covid hit, I got into a new relationship (which what balanced the bad side of daily life), and I started looking for a new home while still stuck in a dead-end job with terrible colleagues. I was lost, depressed, and struggling to find my way back to balance. I tried therapy, but it only helped while I was in the session. Everything felt like a mess, and I didn&rsquo;t have the time or energy to maintain a blog.</p>
<p>Eventually, I left my old job and found a new one in Europe that paid better and had better people, but still wasn&rsquo;t quite what I was looking for. I got married, got my finances in order, and started trying to improve my life one step at a time. I&rsquo;m not as technically proficient as I used to be, but I&rsquo;m slowly getting back into the swing of things.</p>
<p>So why start a blog now? I&rsquo;ve tried social media and failed miserably, maybe because of anxiety or maybe because I&rsquo;m just not that relatable. But I want to share my thoughts with the world, even if it&rsquo;s just a tiny corner of the internet. Writing my own posts on my own blog feels like a good compromise between anonymity and exposure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing about all sorts of things, both technical and non-technical, that I encounter in my daily life. Hopefully someone out there will find it interesting. And as always, I like to say: Alles gut.</p>
