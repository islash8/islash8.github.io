      <description>Greetings, internet! This is my third attempt at writing my &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; blog post, and hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll stick this time. Life has thrown me some curveballs over the past few years, from graduating college to dealing with a breakup and moving away for a 9-month study program that wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite what I hoped for. Then I landed a job at a major automotive company that paid well, but left me feeling unsatisfied and unchallenged.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Islam, and I&amp;rsquo;m a 28-year-old embedded software engineer based in Germany (as of the time I&amp;rsquo;m writting this about me page). I started this blog as a way to share my thoughts and experiences with the world, and to connect with like-minded people who are passionate about technology, sports, humanitarian subjects and so on.
As a software engineer, I have a passion for technology and all things related to the digital world.</description>
