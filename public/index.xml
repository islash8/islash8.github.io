      <description>Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Islam, and I&amp;rsquo;m a 28-year-old embedded software engineer based in Germany (as of the time I&amp;rsquo;m writting this about me page). I started this blog as a way to share my thoughts and experiences with the world, and to connect with like-minded people who are passionate about technology, sports, humanitarian subjects and so on.
As a software engineer, I have a passion for technology and all things related to the digital world.</description>
