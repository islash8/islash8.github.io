**Greetings, Internet!**

This is my third attempt at writing my *first* blog post, and hopefully, this time, I can maintain it!

Life has been quite busy over the past few years. A lot has happened—exciting if you're someone who loves action and unpredictability! However, for me, it has been nothing short of a rollercoaster.

I've been experimenting with Hugo and blogs for almost five years now, but I still don't feel like I've truly mastered it. Every time I set everything up, I tend to leave it as is and move on.

So, why start a blog now?
I've tried social media, but I failed miserably. I'm not entirely sure why, but I think it's simply not for me. I wanted a space to share my thoughts with the world, even if it's just a tiny corner in the vast World Wide Web. Honestly, I don't care if this gains traction or not. Writing my own posts on my own blog feels like the perfect middle ground between anonymity and exposure.

As for what I'll be writing about—I'm not sure yet. I'll probably just talk about random things and toss them into the void out there. Who knows where this journey will lead?
